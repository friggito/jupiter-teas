# Jupiter Teas

Built in one week by 4 tea-loving collaborators: Ornella Friggit, Christine Kim, Jia Li and Ayumi Ono, Jupiter Tea is an e-commerce site to shop for luxury teas. It is built with a REST API connected to a PostgreSQL database, and uses React/Redux on the front-end.

## Primary goal

The primary goal of this project was to learn team-based development techniques. The project was built using an agile workflow, with the team checking in every morning, and working on their objectives in tiers. There was also lots of pair programming and problem-solving on a whiteboard!

## Secondary goal

The secondary goal was tooling and mastery. We got comfortable with Git workflow such as making pull requests, using Travis-CI for continuous integration, and deploying on Heroku.
We also applied a range of tools including React/Redux, PostgreSQL, Sequelize and Express routing. We practiced schema design, testing patterns, and visual design.
